## What have I learned in this project:

- MVC model to architect a full stack application using React and Node and Express
- Login, Logout & Register architecture using endpoints and controllers to communicate with front end
- The use of [Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt-nodejs) to hash passwords and authenticate login
- The use of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) by set up user, manage databases, and creation of tables to store and retrieve data
- The use of [Knex JS](https://knexjs.org/) as a media query builder for PostgreSQL
- Deployment of PostgreSQL via Heroku, setting up databases and server.
- Deployment of the server side via Heroku you can view the application live [HERE](https://facerecognitionbrain-v1.herokuapp.com/)
